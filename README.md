x264_image_transport
====================

This software is derived from the ROS packages made available by IntRoLab, Universite De Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

Specifically, it provides a catkinized image transport plugin for recent versions of ROS, using x264 encoding.

Ubuntu Linux (14.04) does not have ffmpeg in default package source repositories. ffmpeg can be installed using mc3man ppa (personal package archive) using the following steps.

1. Add mc3man ppa to apt source

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media

2. Resynchronize the package index files from their sources

$ sudo apt-get update

3. Check where will ffmpeg be installed

$ apt-cache policy ffmpeg

ffmpeg:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 7:2.8.4+git1~trusty
  Version table:
     7:2.8.4+git1~trusty 0
        500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/mc3man/trusty-media/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages

4. Install ffmpeg using apt-get

$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

--------------

5. build the project using catkin_make
